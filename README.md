# Key Features

## Advanced UI Control

Use the pads to control manu FL Studio UI elements, with lights helping indicate what buttons do what.

## Channel Rack Controls

Use the pads to sequence drums quickly using advanced control of FL Studio's Grid Bit system.

## Mixer Controls

Use the knobs and faders to adjust the panning and volume of tracks, and mute or solo tracks using the mixer buttons.

## Advanced Event Handling

Events are processed in the context of the active window and plugin, allowing for deep integration with FL Studio and plugins. The modular system makes writing event handlers, including plugin and note processor modules, simple and streamlined. The script has the capacity to integrate with almost any plugin, and if it isn't compatible yet, you can code it yourself! The possibilities are endless!
