## A New Script is Available

My Universal Controller Script provides similar advanced support for the Novation Launchkey Mk2 series controllers, but does so in a much
more maintainable way, so that it can be developed for and extended far more easily.

I'm keeping the Novation script up as a public record, but I don't plan to maintain it anymore.

You can access the new script here: https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script
