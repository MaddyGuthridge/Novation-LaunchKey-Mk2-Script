# Key Features

## Advanced UI Control

Use the pads to control manu FL Studio UI elements, with lights helping indicate what buttons do what.

## Channel Rack Controls

Use the pads to sequence drums quickly using advanced control of FL Studio's Grid Bit system.

## Mixer Controls

Use the knobs and faders to adjust the panning and volume of tracks, and mute or solo tracks using the mixer buttons.

## Advanced Event Handling

Events are processed in the context of the active window and plugin, allowing for deep integration with FL Studio and plugins ([see note](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Novation-LaunchKey-Mk2-Script/wiki/Plugin-Specific-Event-Handlers#important-note)). The modular system makes writing event handlers simple, meaning that new features can be added easily over time.
