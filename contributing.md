# Guide to Contributing

This script is designed in order to be modular. This means it is quick and easy to add components to process events and link the controller to any plugin, whilst leaving room for a unique and complex implementation to allow for deep integration.

To get started, you should do the following:

 - Learn Python programming, at least until you understand functions, classes and modules.
 - Get familiar with FL Studio's scripting API.

Then, feel free to read [the documentation](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Novation-LaunchKey-Mk2-Script/wiki/Development-Reference) and start making cool things! Sadly, since I am not familiar with every plugin, I won't be able to test many things you contribute, but I'm sure that many other users of the script will enjoy the integrations you will build.

If you have any questions about writing processor modules for the script, feel free to [email me](mailto:hdsq@outlook.com.au), or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BvXqq3w).
